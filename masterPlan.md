# Master Plan

Strategic overview of customer problems and global hypotheses for the Scout 1 conversational search prototype.

## üéØ Customer Problem(s)

### Primary Problem: Constrained Chatbot Experience
**Current State:** Users interact with AI assistance through small, limited chatbot interfaces that feel disconnected from the main website experience.

**Pain Points:**
- **Form Factor Limitations:** Small chatbot windows restrict information display and interaction capabilities
- **Expectation Mismatch:** Chatbot UI patterns train users to expect limited, transactional interactions
- **Context Disconnection:** Chatbot feels like a separate tool rather than integrated assistance
- **Interaction Constraints:** Limited space prevents rich, contextual responses and natural conversation flow

### Secondary Problem: Traditional Search Limitations
**Current State:** Search experiences remain static and transactional, failing to leverage conversational AI capabilities.

**Pain Points:**
- **Binary Results:** Search returns static lists rather than contextual assistance
- **No Progressive Enhancement:** Search doesn't evolve based on user intent or context
- **Limited Discovery:** Users can't explore or refine their search through natural conversation
- **Missed Opportunities:** Search doesn't leverage AI to understand and assist with user goals

### Root Cause: Paradigm Mismatch
The fundamental issue is that users expect limited capabilities from chatbot interfaces, but conversational search should feel expansive and integrated. We need to transition users from a "tool" mindset to an "assistant" mindset.

## üåç Global Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Progressive Enhancement Enables Adoption
**Statement:** Users will more readily adopt conversational search if it starts from familiar search patterns and progressively enhances to conversational capabilities.

**Rationale:**
- Familiar starting point reduces cognitive load
- Progressive enhancement builds comfort and trust
- Gradual transition prevents jarring experience changes
- Users can opt-in to more advanced features

**Validation Criteria:**
- Users understand the progression from search ‚Üí suggestions ‚Üí conversation
- No confusion about how to enter or exit conversational mode
- Positive feedback about the transition experience
- Increased engagement with conversational features over time

### Hypothesis 2: Integrated Experience Beats Separate Tool
**Statement:** Conversational search that feels integrated with the website experience will be more valuable than a separate chatbot tool.

**Rationale:**
- Context preservation between conversation and site content
- Seamless switching between browsing and assistance
- Enhanced rather than replacement experience
- Maintains user engagement with main site content

**Validation Criteria:**
- Users feel the experience enhances rather than replaces website browsing
- Natural flow between conversation and site content
- Positive stakeholder feedback about complementary nature
- Increased time on site and engagement metrics

### Hypothesis 3: Visual Design Influences User Expectations
**Statement:** Moving away from chatbot UI patterns to expansive, integrated designs will change user expectations about AI assistance capabilities.

**Rationale:**
- Visual design shapes user mental models
- Expansive interfaces suggest broader capabilities
- Integrated design suggests contextual assistance
- Modern, clean design builds trust and confidence

**Validation Criteria:**
- Users expect more from integrated conversational interfaces
- Positive reactions to expansive, modern design
- Reduced "chatbot" mental model references
- Increased willingness to engage with conversational features

### Hypothesis 4: State Management Enables Seamless Transitions
**Statement:** Proper state management and smooth transitions between search modes will create a cohesive, intuitive user experience.

**Rationale:**
- Context preservation across interaction modes
- Smooth animations guide user attention and understanding
- Clear indication of current state and available actions
- Reduced cognitive load during mode switching

**Validation Criteria:**
- Users can navigate between modes without confusion
- Smooth, polished transition animations
- Clear understanding of current state and next actions
- Positive feedback about transition experience

## üéØ Success Indicators

### Customer Problem Validation
- [ ] Users express frustration with current chatbot limitations
- [ ] Users desire more integrated assistance experiences
- [ ] Stakeholders confirm chatbot constraints are real business problems
- [ ] User research validates search enhancement opportunities

### Hypothesis Validation
- [ ] Progressive enhancement approach receives positive feedback
- [ ] Integrated experience feels more valuable than separate tools
- [ ] Visual design changes user expectations about AI capabilities
- [ ] State management creates seamless user experience

## üìä Measurement Strategy

### Qualitative Metrics
- **User Feedback:** Direct stakeholder and user reactions to prototypes
- **Usability Testing:** Observation of user behavior and confusion points
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Business and product team buy-in
- **Design Validation:** Visual and interaction design effectiveness

### Quantitative Indicators
- **Engagement:** Time spent in conversational modes
- **Adoption:** Usage of progressive enhancement features
- **Satisfaction:** User satisfaction with transition experience
- **Performance:** Technical performance of transitions and animations

## üîÑ Iteration Framework

### Phase 1: Problem Validation
- Confirm customer problems through stakeholder interviews
- Validate pain points through user research
- Align on scope and priority of problems

### Phase 2: Hypothesis Testing
- Build prototypes to test each hypothesis
- Collect feedback from stakeholders and users
- Refine hypotheses based on learnings

### Phase 3: Solution Validation
- Test complete conversational search experience
- Validate against success indicators
- Document learnings for future development
