# Concept Notes

Key insights and stakeholder feedback from the Scout 1 conversational search prototype.

## 🎯 Project Insights

### Core Challenge
Moving from constrained chatbot experiences to integrated conversational search requires rethinking the entire interaction paradigm. Users expect limited capabilities from chatbot UIs, but conversational search should feel expansive and integrated.

### Key Realization
This isn't just improving search - it's redefining the relationship between search and assistance. The goal is to create experiences that enhance browsing rather than replace it.

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Transition Approach
- **Progressive enhancement** rather than sudden jumps
- **Familiar starting point** (traditional search) to build comfort
- **Smooth animations** to guide user attention
- **Context preservation** throughout the journey

### Interaction Patterns
- **Expandable suggestions** that feel natural
- **Clear entry points** to conversational mode
- **Obvious exit options** to return to main site
- **State persistence** to maintain context

### Visual Design
- **Color for highlighting** not base (Palette 3 approach)
- **Modern and clean** aesthetic
- **Accessible design** practices
- **Responsive behavior** across devices
