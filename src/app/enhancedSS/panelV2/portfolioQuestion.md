I want to create responses for the panel in conversation mode. So a combo of the question and then looking at the base portfolio page it is being asked on. So if I ask the question on portfolio-positions the question should keep the answer in context.

This will be static. We can have a library of question/answers and instruct users of the prototype follow the script. Therefore this does not have to be heavy tech or complex, so keep the solution simple.

Portfolio-summary questions
1. How are my investments performing?
2. Which of my investments has high risk?

Portfolio-positions questions
1. Which of my stocks pay dividends?
2. Do I have any AI stocks?

We would need to solve for 2 modes, both the panel summary and conversation view.
