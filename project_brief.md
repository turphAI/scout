# Project Brief: Scout 1 Prototype

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Project Name:** Scout 1  
**Type:** UX Prototype Application  
**Date:** August 14 2025  
**Status:** Planning Phase  

## 📋 Project Description

Exploring the transition from constrained chatbot experiences to integrated conversational search. Starting with traditional header search, we'll prototype progressive suggestion interfaces that seamlessly expand into full conversational experiences.

The goal is to create assistive experiences that complement the existing website rather than replace it. Users should feel they're enhancing their browsing, not switching to a separate tool.

### The Challenge

Today our assistant is constrained in a small chatbot UI that limits proper information display. The form factor makes it feel like a traditional chatbot, so users expect limited capabilities. The paradigm of conversational search is changing user expectations - we need to move from a "chatbot in a box" model to something more expansive and integrated.

### The Transition

Instead of just improving search, we're redefining the relationship between search and assistance. The enhanced suggestion panel serves as a transitional interface that:
1. **Starts familiar** (traditional search input)
2. **Expands progressively** (suggestions become more conversational/assistive)  
3. **Transitions seamlessly** into the full conversational experience

Users need to understand this isn't a separate tool they're switching to - it's an enhanced way of interacting with the same website content.

## 🎨 Design Foundation

### Color Palette & Visual Identity
- **Primary Palette:** Flexible color scheme approach (Palette 3 methodology)
- **Design Philosophy:** Modern, clean, and accessible. Color usage for highlight not base.

### Technical Foundation
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **Components:** shadcn/ui component library
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **Deployment:** Vercel-ready

## 🏗️ Architecture Approach

### Focus Areas for Conversational Search
- **Progressive Suggestion Components:** Expandable suggestion panels and conversational UI patterns
- **Transition Animations:** Smooth interactions between search states
- **Conversational Interface:** Full-width conversational experience components
- **State Management:** Managing transitions between search modes

## 🎯 UX Design Principles

### User-Centered Approach
- **User Type:** UX Designer (non-developer perspective)
- **Focus:** Intuitive interactions and visual clarity
- **Testing:** Prototype-driven validation
- **Iteration:** Rapid design iteration cycles

### Design Priorities
1. **Visual Hierarchy:** Clear information architecture
2. **Color Psychology:** Strategic use of color for user guidance
3. **Accessibility:** Inclusive design practices
4. **Performance:** Smooth interactions and fast loading
5. **Responsiveness:** Cross-device compatibility

## 🚀 Development Goals

### Phase 1: Search → Suggestions
- [ ] Basic search input with progressive enhancement
- [ ] Expandable suggestion panel implementation
- [ ] Smooth transition animations between states
- [ ] Mock conversational content for testing

### Phase 2: Suggestions → Conversation
- [ ] Full conversational interface components
- [ ] State management for transition flows
- [ ] User interaction patterns for conversation entry/exit
- [ ] Responsive design for conversational UI

### Phase 3: Full Experience
- [ ] Complete conversational search experience
- [ ] Integration testing with stakeholders
- [ ] Performance optimization for smooth transitions
- [ ] Documentation for concept validation

## 📊 Success Metrics
The main use of the prototypes is for internal conversations and concept validation. Stakeholders and AIX designers need assets to touch, feel, and react to. This is about rapid prototyping. Not spending time in design flats.

### Validation Points
- **Transition Clarity:** Users understand the progression from search → suggestions → conversation
- **Seamless Experience:** No jarring jumps between different interaction modes
- **Complementary Feel:** Experience enhances rather than replaces website browsing
- **Stakeholder Feedback:** Positive reactions to concept demonstrations
