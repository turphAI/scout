# Prototype Guide

How to navigate and test each transition in the Scout 1 conversational search experience.

## ðŸŽ¯ Testing Overview

This guide helps you understand and test the three key transitions in our conversational search prototype. Each phase builds on the previous one to create a seamless experience.

## ðŸ“± Phase 1: Search â†’ Suggestions

**URL:** `/search-to-suggestions`

### What to Test
- Traditional search input behavior
- Progressive enhancement as you type
- Suggestion panel expansion
- Smooth animations between states

### Test Scenarios
1. **Basic Search:** Type a simple query and observe traditional search behavior
2. **Progressive Enhancement:** Notice how suggestions become more conversational
3. **Panel Expansion:** Watch the suggestion panel grow and adapt
4. **State Transitions:** Observe smooth animations between search states

### Key Interactions
- **Type slowly:** Watch suggestions evolve from basic to conversational
- **Hover over suggestions:** See how they respond to interaction
- **Click suggestions:** Observe how they expand or transition

## ðŸ’¬ Phase 2: Suggestions â†’ Conversation

**URL:** `/suggestions-to-conversation`

### What to Test
- Full conversational interface
- Entry and exit patterns
- State management during transitions
- Responsive design in conversation mode

### Test Scenarios
1. **Entry Point:** How do users enter the conversational experience?
2. **Conversation Flow:** Test the natural conversation progression
3. **Exit Patterns:** How do users return to the main site?
4. **State Persistence:** Does the conversation state maintain context?

### Key Interactions
- **Enter conversation:** Click or select to enter full conversational mode
- **Navigate conversation:** Test back-and-forth dialogue
- **Exit gracefully:** Find ways to return to the main site
- **Context switching:** Test moving between conversation and site content

## ðŸŒŸ Phase 3: Full Experience

**URL:** `/full-conversation`

### What to Test
- Complete conversational search experience
- Integration with website content
- Performance and smoothness
- End-to-end user journey

### Test Scenarios
1. **Complete Journey:** Start with search, progress through suggestions, enter conversation
2. **Content Integration:** How does conversation relate to site content?
3. **Performance:** Are transitions smooth and responsive?
4. **User Flow:** Does the entire experience feel natural?

### Key Interactions
- **Full flow:** Test the complete search â†’ suggestions â†’ conversation journey
- **Content relevance:** Check how conversation relates to site content
- **Performance:** Notice loading times and transition smoothness
- **User satisfaction:** Does this feel like an enhancement or replacement?

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Patterns to Observe

### Transition Animations
- **Smooth scaling:** Elements grow/shrink naturally
- **Fade transitions:** Content appears/disappears gracefully
- **Position shifts:** Elements move smoothly between states
- **Timing consistency:** All animations feel coordinated

### Interaction Feedback
- **Hover states:** Clear visual feedback on interactive elements
- **Loading states:** Appropriate indicators during transitions
- **Error handling:** Graceful handling of edge cases
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Progressive disclosure:** Information appears as needed
- **Focus management:** Clear indication of current state
- **Context preservation:** Users always know where they are
- **Visual continuity:** Consistent design language throughout
